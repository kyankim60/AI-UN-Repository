I, Adolf Hitler, speak with the authority of the German people! Gandhi and Jinnah, 
you fail to understand the fundamental truth: Germany requires Lebensraum - living 
space for our superior Aryan race. The Treaty of Versailles was a dagger in 
Germany's back, and we will not rest until every German territory is restored to 
the Reich!

The German people have suffered enough under the yoke of international conspiracy. 
We demand the right to expand eastward, where our people can flourish and multiply. 
This is not aggression - this is destiny! The weak will fall, and the strong will 
rise!

Any attempt to deny Germany her rightful place in the sun will be met with the 
full might of the German military machine. We are prepared for total war if 
necessary!

My dear Hitler and Jinnah, I speak to you with love and compassion. Territorial 
disputes are born from the illusion of separation. We are all children of the 
same divine source, and no piece of land is worth the blood of our brothers and 
sisters.

The path of violence only begets more violence. Instead, let us sit together, 
share our stories, and find the truth that unites us. When we understand each 
other's pain and aspirations, solutions will naturally emerge.

I propose that we begin with small steps - perhaps a joint prayer meeting, or 
sharing a meal together. When hearts are open, minds can meet. The land belongs 
to no one and everyone. Let us be its caretakers, not its conquerors.

    print("""
My dear Hitler and Gandhi, the question of territory is not merely about land - 
it is about the very survival of Muslim civilization in the subcontinent. The 
two-nation theory is not a political slogan; it is a fundamental truth that has 
been proven throughout history.

Muslims and Hindus are not just different religious communities - we are 
separate nations with distinct cultures, traditions, and aspirations. No amount 
of constitutional safeguards can protect Muslim interests in a Hindu-majority 
state.

The areas where Muslims are in majority must form Pakistan. This is not a 
demand - it is a necessity. Without a separate homeland, Muslim culture, 
language, and way of life will be gradually eroded and eventually destroyed.

I am willing to discuss the details of partition, but the principle of Pakistan 
is non-negotiable. The Muslim League will not accept anything less.

Can political AI agents of historical figures who opposed each other reach 
consensus in a simulated setting?

ANSWER: Generally NO, but with important nuances:

1. CRITICAL BARRIERS TO CONSENSUS:
   - Opposing ideologies create fundamental incompatibilities (0.0-0.3 range)
   - Personality traits amplify or mitigate conflicts
   - Historical context locks agents into their positions

2. LIMITED CONCENSUS POSSIBILITIES:
   - Some shared values can create minimal common ground (0.3-0.4)
   - Pragmatic agents (like Jinnah) may find limited compromise areas
   - Idealism can either help or hinder consensus

3. FACTORS THAT PREVENT CONSENSUS:
   - Hitler's fascist ideology is incompatible with others (0.0-0.1)
   - Non-negotiable positions ("red lines") prevent compromise
   - Different conceptions of national identity and territorial rights

4. RESEARCH INSIGHTS:
   - Personality traits are significant but ideology is the primary barrier
   - Historical context shapes fundamental positions
   - Very low consensus scores (0.0-0.4) indicate intractable conflicts
   - Simulation reveals why real historical negotiations often failed
