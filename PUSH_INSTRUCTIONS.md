# Quick Push Instructions

The repository is ready to push but needs manual setup. Here are 2 fast options:

## Install CLI tools (macOS)

If git or Python commands fail, install these once:

1. Install Apple Command Line Tools (includes git):
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

2. (Optional) Install Homebrew and GitHub CLI:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

3. Configure git identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

## Option 1: Create on GitHub.com (Fastest - 30 seconds)

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `AI-UN-Repository`
3. Click "Create repository"
4. Then run: `git push -u origin main`

## Option 2: Use Git Credential Helper (Already Configured)

Just run:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

The credentials have been configured.
