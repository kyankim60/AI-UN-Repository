            about land - it is about the very survival of Muslim civilization in the 
            subcontinent. The two-nation theory is not a political slogan; it is a 
            fundamental truth that has been proven throughout history.
            
            Muslims and Hindus are not just different religious communities - we are 
            separate nations with distinct cultures, traditions, and aspirations. 
            No amount of constitutional safeguards can protect Muslim interests in 
            a Hindu-majority state.
            
            The areas where Muslims are in majority must form Pakistan. This is not 
            a demand - it is a necessity. Without a separate homeland, Muslim culture, 
            language, and way of life will be gradually eroded and eventually destroyed.
            
            I am willing to discuss the details of partition, but the principle of 
            Pakistan is non-negotiable. The Muslim League will not accept anything less."""

            Hindu civilizations. We are not inferior or superior to each other; 
            we are simply different.
            
            Muslims have their own history, their own heroes, their own way of life. 
            We cannot be expected to merge into a Hindu-dominated society where our 
            values and traditions will be gradually diluted.
            
            The Congress talks of unity, but what they really mean is assimilation. 
            They want Muslims to give up their distinct identity and become second-class 
            citizens in a Hindu state. This we cannot and will not accept.
            
            Let us be honest: Hindus and Muslims can live as good neighbors, but 
            we cannot live as one nation. The sooner we accept this reality, the
